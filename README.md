# Professional Data Analysis

This repository contains data science projects and their discriptions. It is composed of:

## [Introduction to Python](https://github.com/hendyy25/Udacity---Data-Analysis-Professional/tree/main/Introduction%20to%20Python)
I wrote sample codes in Pandas and Numpy in Jupyter notebooks white learning those concepts.
## 
## [Projects](https://github.com/hendyy25/Udacity---Data-Analysis-Professional/tree/main/Projects)
After self-learning the materials in the Udacity nano-degree, I completed 2 technical projects and 1 freelance project.

• The Movie Database
Explored properties of movies collected from 1960 to 2010 and provided various types of visualization that relate 2 or more variables. Provided data-driven advice for the best movie executive directors and companies to better target their audience.

• U.S. Bikeshare Project
Utilized Python Numpy and Pandas to calculate essential statistics and created an interactive environment for users to analyze data based on their preferences.

• Simulated working with a client in a freelance environment by responding to a project description, writing an expression of interest, managing the development process using the Trello app, and finalizing an invoice.
